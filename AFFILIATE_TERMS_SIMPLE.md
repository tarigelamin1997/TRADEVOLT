# TradeVolt Affiliate Program - Simple Summary 

*This is a plain-English summary of our Affiliate Terms. The full legal terms still apply, but this helps you understand the key points.*

## üéØ The Basics

**What is this?** You promote TradeVolt, and we pay you commissions when people sign up through your link.

**How much can I earn?** Up to 50% commission ($14.50 per $29 sale) for 12 months per customer.

**When do I get paid?** Monthly on the 10th (for previous month's earnings). Need $100 minimum to get paid.

## üí∞ How Commissions Work

### Your Commission Tier (Based on Last 30 Days of Sales)

| Your Monthly Sales | Your Rate | You Earn Per Sale |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Under $2,000 | 10% | $2.90 |
| $2,000-$4,999 | 25% | $7.25 |
| $5,000-$9,999 | 35% | $10.15 |
| $10,000+ | 50% | $14.50 |

**Example:** If you bring in 100 customers at $29/month and you're in the Diamond tier (50%), you earn $1,450/month for 12 months = $17,400 total!
